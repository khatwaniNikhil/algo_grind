# Ways to formulate longest_non_consecutive_sum are:
# 1. We have a flower box with a few places to plant flowers. Each location has nutrients that influence how tall the flower will be. You can't plant flowers next to each other, and we want to maximize the total height of all the planted flowers ?
# 2. you are a robber who has found a block of houses to rob. Each house ùëñ has a non-negative ùë£ùëñ worth of value inside that you can steal. However, due to the way the security systems of the houses are connected, you‚Äôll get caught if you rob two adjacent houses. What‚Äôs the maximum value you can steal from the block?

# Breaking into sub problems, here i means, all elements from index 0 to ith index are considered
# max_non_consec_sum(i) = max(
#                            v(i)+ max_non_consec_sum(i-2),
#                            max_non_consec_sum(i-1)    

# since we want to consider elements at each index from 0 to n-1, so problem we need to solve is max_non_consec_sum(n-1)
